# Privacy Policy for Lightio

**Last updated: May 16, 2025**

Lightio collects data based on your interactions and consent settings:

## Data We Collect

*   **Essential Data (Collected by default for core functionality):**
    *   Images you capture or upload for object detection (these are processed locally on your device and are not transmitted unless you explicitly use a feature that requires it, which would be separately disclosed).
    *   Detection results (object labels derived from your images) used to find relevant hadiths.
    *   Your history of detected objects and viewed hadiths (stored locally on your device).
    *   Favorites you save (stored locally on your device).
*   **Analytics Data (Only if 'Analytics' consent is given):**
    *   Anonymous app usage information, such as feature usage frequency, session duration, and crash reports. This helps us understand how our app is used and to improve its performance and stability.
*   **UI Personalization Data (Only if 'UI Personalization' consent is given):**
    *   Preferences you set for the app's user interface (e.g., theme choices, layout adjustments) to tailor the app's appearance to your liking.
*   **Data Personalization Data (Only if 'Data Personalization' consent is given, 'UI Personalization' is active, and your profile is complete):**
    *   User profile information you voluntarily provide, such as gender, date of birth, email address, or phone number.
    *   Your interaction patterns with hadiths and detected objects.
*   **Cloud Storage Data (Only if 'Cloud Storage' consent is given):**
    *   If you opt-in for cloud storage, your history and favorites data may be securely backed up to the cloud. This is to enable synchronization across devices or data recovery. Images themselves are not part of this standard cloud backup unless a specific feature explicitly states so and obtains separate confirmation.

By default, images and primary data like history and favorites are stored locally on your device.

## How We Use Your Data

We use your data to:

*   **Provide Core Functionality (Essential Data):**
    *   Detect objects in your images (local processing on your device).
    *   Find relevant hadiths based on detected object labels by sending these labels (not the images themselves) to our hadith search service.
    *   Maintain your local history and favorites.
*   **Improve Our App (Analytics Data - if consent given):**
    *   Analyze usage patterns to identify popular features, troubleshoot issues, and enhance overall app functionality and user experience.
*   **Tailor Your Experience (UI Personalization Data - if consent given):**
    *   Customize the app's appearance and layout based on your saved preferences.
*   **Offer Personalized Content (Data Personalization Data - if consent given, UI Personalization active, and profile complete):**
    *   Utilize your provided profile information and interaction patterns to offer more relevant hadith suggestions or personalized app features.
*   **Enable Cloud Features (Cloud Storage Data - if consent given):**
    *   Securely back up and synchronize your history and favorites data across your devices, or assist in restoring it if you change devices.

Your images are processed locally on your device using our ML model. Only object labels are sent to our hadith search service (DigitalOcean GenAI) to find relevant results.

## Third-Party Services

Lightio uses the following third-party services:

*   DigitalOcean GenAI service for hadith search

When you search for hadiths, the object label (not the image) is sent to our secure API hosted on DigitalOcean.

## Your GDPR Rights

Under the GDPR, you have the following rights:

*   Right to access your data
*   Right to rectify inaccurate data
*   Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten")
*   Right to restrict processing
*   Right to data portability
*   Right to object to processing

You can exercise these rights through the app's Privacy & Data settings.

## Data Security

We take the security of your data seriously:

*   All data is encrypted during transmission
*   We use secure servers for our API
*   We regularly review our security practices
*   We limit access to your data to authorized personnel only

In the event of a data breach that affects your personal data, we will notify you within 72 hours as required by GDPR.

## Data Retention

We retain your data for as long as necessary to provide you with our services:

*   History data is stored locally until you delete it or clear your history.
*   Favorites are stored locally until you remove them.
*   User profile information (if provided for Data Personalization) is retained until you clear your profile or delete all user data.
*   If Cloud Storage consent is given, your backed-up data is retained in the cloud until you disable cloud storage for that data type or delete all your user data.
*   You can delete your local and, where applicable, cloud-stored data at any time through the app's settings.

When you delete data through the app, it is permanently removed from your device and, if applicable, our cloud systems.

## Children's Privacy

Our app is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.

We will also notify you through an in-app notification before the changes take effect.
