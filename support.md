# Lightio Help & Support

## About Lightio

Lightio is an innovative mobile application that combines object detection technology with Islamic knowledge. Our app helps users discover relevant hadiths by analyzing objects in their surroundings, making Islamic learning more accessible and interactive.

## About Us

Hi, I'm Mohammad Sani Suprayogi (Yogie), and together with my wife, Ami, we are the team behind Lightio. I initiated this project, originally from Yogyakarta, Indonesia, to bridge technology and Islamic education. Ami has been instrumental in supporting and contributing to the development of Lightio, helping to bring this vision to life. Our shared goal is to make Islamic learning more accessible and interactive.

## Support Our Work

We're committed to keeping Lightio free and accessible. If you'd like to support our development efforts, in-app donation options will be available soon. Your support helps us improve and add new features.
