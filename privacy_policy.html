            <h1>Privacy Policy for Lightio</h1>
            <p><strong>Last updated: May 16, 2025</strong></p>
            <p>Lightio collects data based on your interactions and consent settings:</p>

            <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Essential Data (Collected by default for core functionality):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Images you capture or upload for object detection (these are processed locally on your device and are not transmitted unless you explicitly use a feature that requires it, which would be separately disclosed).</li>
                        <li>Detection results (object labels derived from your images) used to find relevant hadiths.</li>
                        <li>Your history of detected objects and viewed hadiths (stored locally on your device).</li>
                        <li>Favorites you save (stored locally on your device).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Analytics Data (Only if 'Analytics' consent is given):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Anonymous app usage information, such as feature usage frequency, session duration, and crash reports. This helps us understand how our app is used and to improve its performance and stability.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>UI Personalization Data (Only if 'UI Personalization' consent is given):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Preferences you set for the app's user interface (e.g., theme choices, layout adjustments) to tailor the app's appearance to your liking.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data Personalization Data (Only if 'Data Personalization' consent is given, 'UI Personalization' is active, and your profile is complete):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>User profile information you voluntarily provide, such as gender, date of birth, email address, or phone number.</li>
                        <li>Your interaction patterns with hadiths and detected objects.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cloud Storage Data (Only if 'Cloud Storage' consent is given):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you opt-in for cloud storage, your history and favorites data may be securely backed up to the cloud. This is to enable synchronization across devices or data recovery. Images themselves are not part of this standard cloud backup unless a specific feature explicitly states so and obtains separate confirmation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>By default, images and primary data like history and favorites are stored locally on your device.</p>

            <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
